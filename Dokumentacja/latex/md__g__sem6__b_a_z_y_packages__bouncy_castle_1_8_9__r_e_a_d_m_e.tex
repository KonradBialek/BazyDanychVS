The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a C\# implementation of cryptographic algorithms and protocols, it was developed by the Legion of the Bouncy Castle, a registered Australian Charity, with a little help! The Legion, and the latest goings on with this package, can be found at {\texttt{ http\+://www.\+bouncycastle.\+org}}. In addition to providing basic cryptography algorithms, the package also provides support for CMS, TSP, X.\+509 certificate generation and a variety of other standards such as Open\+PGP.

The Legion also gratefully acknowledges the contributions made to this package by others (see {\texttt{ here}} for the current list). If you would like to contribute to our efforts please feel free to get in touch with us or visit our {\texttt{ donations page}}, sponsor some specific work, or purchase a support contract through {\texttt{ Crypto Workshop}}.

Except where otherwise stated, this software is distributed under a license based on the MIT X Consortium license. To view the license, {\texttt{ see here}}. The Open\+PGP library also includes a modified BZIP2 library which is licensed under the {\texttt{ Apache Software License, Version 2.\+0}}.

{\bfseries{Note}}\+: this source tree is not the FIPS version of the APIs -\/ if you are interested in our FIPS version please contact us directly at {\texttt{ office@bouncycastle.\+org}}.\doxysection{Mailing Lists}\label{md__g__sem6__b_a_z_y_packages__bouncy_castle_1_8_9__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
